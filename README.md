- Getting Started
- online voting system uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard for describing the structure and presentation of information via the Internet. Web developers use HTML keywords to instruct the Web browser application to format and display the content of Web pages.
- CSS allows you to control and adjust the design and formatting of your entire website (no matter how big or small it is) from a single spot. This is done using what’s called an external style sheet.
- PHP is particularly good at interacting with MySQL databases, which opens endless possibilities.
You can write user-submitted information to a database as well as retrieve information from the database. This allows you to create pages on the fly using the contents of the database.
- Javascript is used to Add interactive behavior to web pages. JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages.
